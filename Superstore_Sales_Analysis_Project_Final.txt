 - created the product, orders, customer, and returns tables
********************************/

show tables;    # Made sure there were no tables created yet in the database

# A.1 Created the framework and data types for the PRODUCT table:

# A.3 Created and loaded the CUSTOMER table:

drop table if exists superstore.customer;

  CustomerID int,
  CustomerName varchar(50),
  Province varchar (50),
  Region varchar (50),
  CustomerSegment Varchar(20),

# B.2 What are the dates of the first and last orders placed?

-- 2009-01-01 is the first date of transactions

select orderdate from superstore.orders 
order by orderdate desc limit 5;
-- 2012-12-30 is the last date of transactions

-- Thus, the range of orders is from January 1, 2009 to December 30, 2012.

# B.3 Are there consistent orders throughout the year for each year?
select year(OrderDate) as OrderYear,

       day(OrderDate) as OrderDay
from superstore.orders

-- In terms of YOY profit growth rate, there has been a negative growth rate for most years, 
-- meaning that although the business has been earning a positive profit for all four years, 
-- the profit amount is shrinking. This alone doesnâ€™t conclusively indicate whether the business is 
-- doing well or not, as factors such as expansion of the business or economic recession can affect the profits.


# C.4.1	With shipping cost being the only expense data available, what is the total shipping cost per year?

select year(orderdate) as orderyear, 
	sum(shippingcost) as totalshipping

# C.4.2 What is the change in shipping cost YoY?

2009-2010 = -5.6%
2010-2011 = -9.9% 
2011-2012 = 10.6% 

During consistent periods of negative growth rate YOY for profit, shipping costs (the only expense indicated) 
actually decreased from 2009-2011. Assuming there was no business expansion or big investments made, 
that means revenue in total had to have decreased. This can indicate that for 2009, 2010, and 2011 the 
number of items ordered and/or mass of items ordered decreased (leading to both decreased shipping costs and profits), 
the profit margins of the ordered products were smaller, the cost of shipping itself decreased (fuel costs, 
more efficient logistics routes etc) and/or the discounts used also increased (reducing the profit margins).

-- The maximum average sales per order occured in 2009, followed by 2012, 2011, then 2010.
-- Generally, 2009 performed best in terms of sales and orders, which both overall declined in subsequent years.
-- Overall analysis:
/*The total sales, total quantity of items ordered, and total number of orders placed YoY between 2009 and 2010 
consistently decreased as did the profits. Moreover, the average price of items purchased decreased during that 
period from 106.14 to around 73.5, while the average discount provided to customers increased each year (both resulting in lower revenue). 
-Although shipping costs may have decreased from 2009-2010, it's possible that having fewer orders and perhaps shipping 
lighter items may have contributed to that decrease. 
-Although total sales, total quantity of items ordered and total orders increased from 2011 to 2012, the shipping costs also
increased while profit decreased, so that increase is marginal. The increase in average price to 90.31 also doesnâ€™t meet the 
initial higher average price of 106.14.*/

# F. Conclusion about YoY Performance
 ***************************************/
 /*
-- I concluded that Superstore's YoY performance from 2009 to 2012 generally worsened given that:
-- In terms of YOY profit, there was a negative growth rate for most years.
-- The total sales, total quantity of items ordered, and total number of orders placed YoY also geerally decreased. 
-- Moreover, the average price of items purchased decreased while the average discount provided to customers 
   increased each year, both resulting in lower revenue YoY. 
-- Although total sales, total quantity of items ordered and total orders increased from 2011 to 2012, the shipping costs also
   increased while profit decreased, so that increase is marginal. The increase in average price of ordered items to 90.31 also 
   didnâ€™t meet the initial higher average price of 106.14 in 2009.
-- There were no outstanding changes in the number of customers purchasing and customers compositions per year.
